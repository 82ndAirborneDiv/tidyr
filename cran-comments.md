## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.1.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on the two downstream dependencies of tidyr 
(https://github.com/hadley/tidyr/blob/master/revdep/summary.md). Both packages passed without ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
